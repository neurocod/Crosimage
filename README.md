Fullscreen view. Main image is on the center, and free space at the sides is used to show next and previous images in the folder. Of course this can be switched off.

When there are many top-level windows and you want to locate window with proper folder, press `Ctrl+tab` to show `Window manager` - with preview of each window.

It automatically adjusts for any windows count, so in situations like 5+ windows it is very useful.
